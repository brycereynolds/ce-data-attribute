# ce-data-attribute
A chrome extension for reading data-attributes. Right now this is hardcoded to specific attributes, but a settings page is ready to make this more general.

### Installation
* Clone/download repository.
* Go to chrome://extensions
* Click "Load unpacked extension" and choose this folder.
* You should see a tool called "Data Attribute Grabber" has been added to your extensions.
* You should also see the tool is now available in the status menu (next to the browser address bar).


### Want to help?
We'd like to make this tool more general. Currently it uses some hard-coded data-attribute values. A settings page is ready for updating to make this happen.

Also, we need an icon.
